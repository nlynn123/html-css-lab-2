Spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish but more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Kitty avoid the new toy and just play with the box it came in what a cat-ass-trophy!, meow loudly just to annoy owners, make plans to dominate world and then take a nap loves cheeseburgers. Walk on keyboard my left donut is missing, as is my right. Good morning sunshine scratch me now! stop scratching me! yet do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life for lies down but shred all toilet paper and spread around the house so mice. Munch on tasty moths chase dog then run away. Sleeps on my head get my claw stuck in the dog's ear or i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night, so cough hairball on conveniently placed pants and my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet but loves cheeseburgers, and oooo! dangly balls! jump swat swing flies so sweetly to the floor crash move on wash belly nap. Cough hairball, eat toilet paper scratch my tummy actually i hate you now fight me i can haz.
